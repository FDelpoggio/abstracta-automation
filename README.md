#### Description

##### UI Automation: 

A new online clothing store needs to know if its prices are competitive before going on the market, so they ask us to create a test in Selenium, WebDriverIO, or Playwright that obtains the information from the first 3 pages of MercadoLibre when searching for “camisetas” to be able to use that information in the testing database.

##### API Automation: 

The pet store “PerfDog” is developing a new version of its website. Since the store owners know that there is no better way to sell a pet than by having a quality website, they decide to conduct tests on it. Since the front end is not finished, it is decided to start testing the functionalities using the application API, which will be delivered at the end of the next sprint. For this first version, we are asked to validate that the following scenario will work correctly:

Step 1 - Login
Step 2 - List available pets
Step 3 - Check data for an available pet
Step 4 - Create an order for a pet
Step 5 - Update User
Step 6 - Logout
